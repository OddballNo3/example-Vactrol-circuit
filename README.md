Simple explanatory vactrol driver with arduino code

This is a DAC in its most simple form.  For the example you will find a full schematic for a filter from one of my favorite eurorack DIY designers Non Linear Circuits (NLC). In the upper left hand corner you will see a voltage divider pot to control frequency, you would replace that with this circuit and script.
